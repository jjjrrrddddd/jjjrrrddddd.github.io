        <p>BLURB: 
In the 2012 MICF Class Clowns national final i suffered a humiliating loss to aar*n ch*n and others. since then i have moved silently, lurking in the shadows, biding my time, building my empire...

13 years have passed and I am much older (28), my hair is falling out, and soon the cruel hands of father time will play my bald dome like a bongo drum. What I am trying to say is that time moves really quickly and the world you were born into no longer exists.
