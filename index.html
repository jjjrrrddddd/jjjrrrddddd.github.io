    <h3>the world you were born into no longer exists</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>When I was in year 6, my friend Pat bluetoothed™ me a pretty violent video of a guy dying from doing a backflip off a bridge. Although the backflip was mad hectic, you could definitely tell that he died which was kind of not that chill.

Now I am much older (28), my hair is falling out, and soon the cruel hands of father time will play my bald dome like a bongo drum. What I am trying to say is that time moves really quickly and the world you were born into no longer exists.
